    <h1>Kata: Holiday VIII - Duty Free</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this kata is to work out just how many bottles of duty
      <br />
      free whiskey you would have to buy such that the saving over the normal
      <br />
      high street price would effectively cover the cost of your holiday.<br />
      <br />
      You will be given the high street price (normPrice), the duty free
      discount <br />
      (discount) and the cost of the holiday.<br />
      <br />
      For example, if a bottle cost £10 normally and the discount in duty free
      <br />
      was 10%, you would save £1 per bottle. If your holiday cost £500, the
      answer <br />
      you should return would be 500.<br />
      <br />
      All inputs will be integers. Please return an integer. Round down.<br />
